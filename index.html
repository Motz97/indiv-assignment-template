      <h3>Interpretation</h3>

      <p>
        My project is a comparison between the Big Three in tennis, Novak, Rafa and Roger. By choosing the 15 major tournaments, I tried to make a graph 
        that shows us how many times each of them has won that title. At first sight, we notice that Rafa is not always the best, but when he is, he wins 
        many more titles than his competitors. Djokovic, present in almost every title and always above average, either the best or the second best. 
        Federer, is also better in many tournaments, but we notice that he has a preference for some. For the second view, we tried to classify the 
        tournaments by type, Clay, Grass and Hard. Conclusion, the most versatile player is Djokovic, he excels in all three, with more details in the first
        table. Federer is the Grass specialist with also Hard but without any favour for Clay. Rafa, as he is called, The King of Clay, dominates this court
        with a much lesser preference for Hard.
        Djokovic has the highest number of titles of all and that is due to his versatility. To be the best, you have to be able to adapt to all conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        Since this is an area I love and have been following for a very long time, I didn't find it too difficult to get the data. What was complicated was 
        how to arrange them, because my data is more qualitative with the names of the tournaments. The hardest part of the job was to get the second graph 
        out; classifying the tournaments by type of court and then trying to plot them to find out the speciality of each player, that was not easy.
